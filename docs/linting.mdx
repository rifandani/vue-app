# Linting

## ESLint

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and formatting.<br />
We decided to use ESLint for both linting and formatting because we agree with [Anthony blog post](https://antfu.me/posts/why-not-prettier).<br />
We also use his ESLint config which is a really good starting point for Vue projects.<br />
We implement the new [ESLint Flat Config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files) which is recommended in the v9+.<br />
The linting rules are configured in `eslint.config.js`.
