# Testing

## Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript.<br />
It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete.<br />
To run type checking across the whole project, run `pnpm typecheck`.

## Vitest

For lower level tests of utils/helpers pure functions, we use `vitest`.<br />
To run the tests, run `pnpm test:quiet`.<br />
To run & watch the tests, run `pnpm test`.<br />
To run and spin up the test UI, run `pnpm test:ui`.<br />
To run coverage, run `pnpm test:coverage`.<br />

## Storybook

For component and story tests, we use `@storybook/test-runner`.<br />
To run the tests, run `pnpm storybook:test`.<br />
